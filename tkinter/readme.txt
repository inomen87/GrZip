This is a language learning app that helps us learn French.
It already works and code is finished.

The principle is the following:
1. French word is shown in window
2. If we know the word in English we press green "ðŸ—¸" button and word is deleted from a "words_to_learn.csv" file.
   Then a new word gets shown.
3. If we don't know the word in English we press red "X" button and that word stays in a list "words_to_learn.csv"
   but also a new French word gets shown.
4. 3000 milliseconds after showing a French word, the app automatically switches to English translation
   if we don't click any buttons.
